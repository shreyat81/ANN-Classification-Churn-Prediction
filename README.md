# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks

This project predicts **customer churn** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** trained on the popular **Churn_Modelling.csv** dataset. The goal is to determine whether a customer is likely to leave a bank, based on features like geography, balance, credit score, etc.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

**Churn** is the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. Reducing churn is critical for business growth. This project uses **deep learning (ANN)** to classify whether a customer will churn based on features like:

- Credit Score
- Age
- Balance
- Gender
- Geography
- Tenure
- Estimated Salary
- Number of Products
- Active Membership

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Churn_Modelling.csv
- **Samples**: 10,000 customer records
- **Target**: `Exited` column (0 = not churned, 1 = churned)

---

## 🔧 Preprocessing

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Label Encoding for `Gender`
  - OneHot Encoding for `Geography`
- **Scaling**:
  - Features scaled using `StandardScaler`
- **Saved Models**:
  - Encoders and scalers are saved using `pickle` for reuse during inference.

---

## 🧪 Model Development

- **Frameworks Used**: TensorFlow + Keras (via scikeras)
- **Model Architecture**:
  - Input layer based on encoded features
  - Two hidden layers (with ReLU activation)
  - Output layer with sigmoid activation
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy  
- **Optimizer**: Adam  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC

---

## 🔁 Hyperparameter Tuning

Performed using `GridSearchCV` with `KerasClassifier` via `scikeras`. Tuned parameters:

- Number of neurons
- Batch size
- Epochs
- Optimizer choice

Results and best parameters are documented in hyperparametertuningann.ipynb.

---

## 🧪 Experiments & Results

Model evaluation includes:

- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve
- Classification Report
- Accuracy trends across different hyperparameter combinations

Refer to experiments.ipynb for detailed analysis.

---

## 🚀 Inference

To predict churn for new customer data:

1. Apply the same label/one-hot encoding.
2. Scale input using scaler.pkl
3. Load `model.h5` and make predictions using prediction.ipynb.
